# 盾盾日语教室 (Dun Dun Japanese Classroom) - Lesson 1

> **Japanese_Learning-**: All through journey Japan

Welcome to the **Japanese Lesson 1** website project! This project is a standalone, interactive web experience designed to teach the Japanese 50-sound table (starting with the Vowels: A-I-U-E-O).

## Features

- **Interactive 50-Sound Chart**: Hover over characters to see their connection.
- **Mnemonic Flip Cards**: Click on the vowel cards (あ, い, う, え, お) to reveal memory aids (e.g., "Ah" for Tian'anmen).
- **Visual Writing Guides**: Stroke order diagrams for both Hiragana and Katakana.
- **Pronunciation Rules**: Visual explanations of Japanese Pitch Accent (Intonation) and Aspiration rules (ka/ta/pa).
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for mobile and desktop support.
